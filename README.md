## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:

We are wanting to gather data to create a new model to predict property values. We have one currently that we would like to improve upon and use our data as a tool to help us find trends that can help our predictions. At Zillow, this data is important because our customers need to be able to trust that we can give them accurate predictions for value.

-> 1. Construct a Regression model that can properly predict the estimated property value of <b> Single Family Properties </b>.
    
    
-> 2. Present a report to team that shows my processes and how I came to my conclusions.


-> 3. Make recommendations on what are attributes to consider when predicting property value.

 ### Business Goals: 
 > - As a junior Data Scientist, my goals are to use the data I have to create a ML Regression model that beats our current model on predicting property value. I want to be able to zero in on potential factors that I find correlate most to predicting these values, as it is very important to our company to be trustworthy with the information we provide our customers. 

 ### Audience:
> - My audience is the Zillow data science team. 
  
  
 ### Deliverables:
> - A final report notebook
> - A final report notebook presentation
> - Workbooks that were used while going through the steps to create my model
